feat(modules): add unique welcome screens for each module

Adds a unique welcome screen to the `Estudio`, `Examen`, and `Conversaciones` modules.

Each welcome screen provides a brief introduction to the module's functionality, with a design consistent with the application's home screen.

This improves the user experience by offering a clear and attractive entry point to each section of the application.

fix(components): correct `useRef` call in `ConversationDetail`

Moves the `React.useRef` call inside the `ConversationDetail` component to comply with the Rules of Hooks.

This ensures that the `isPlayingAllRef` reference is correctly created and that the component renders without errors.
