fix(conversations): stop playback when leaving module

Adds a cleanup function to the `ConversationDetail` component to stop the speech synthesis when the component unmounts.

This fixes a bug where the "Play All" feature in the `Conversaciones` module would not stop when the user navigated to another module.
